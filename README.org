~tflite-react-native~ runs an image through a TFLite model and returns
the serialized output. It infers the input and output shapes from the
model file and does not interpret the output, but the image processing
is currently hard-coded to work with Posenet.

This module is used to do pose detection for static images in the RN
Posera app, but it can be replaced by [[https://github.com/indigoviolet/react-native-pose-decoding][react-native-pose-decoding]],
which can generalize to other pose detection models.
